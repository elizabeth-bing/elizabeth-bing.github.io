   <h1>IQ vs EQ</h1>
   
   <p><strong> What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></p>
   <p> <em><strong> "The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” - Salovey and Mayer 1990 </strong> </em> </p>
      
   <p> <strong> How is it different to IQ? </strong></p>
     <ul>
       <li> IQ is the ability to solve problems, use logic, and solve complex ideas. </li>
       <li> EQ is the ability to recognise emotion in yourself and others and then use this awareness to your advantage. </li>
     </ul>
      
 <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
     <ul>
       <li> Assist in being a point of difference, e.g. job hunting, choosing a person who is a better fit rather than being good with technical skills but not a good fit.  </li>
       <li> Helps deal with challenges in life, studies show EQ is twice as important the IQ in a work environment. To achieve higher levels, need EQ because it is the differentiating factor among people.  </li>
      <li> EQ relates to skills such as:
        <li> Achievement drive and standards</li>
        <li>Influence</li>
        <li>Initiative</li>
       <li> Self-Confidence</li>
      </ul>
