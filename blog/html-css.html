  <h1>CSS Margins, Borders and Padding </h1>
  <h2> Welcome to the first of my articles as I attempt to break down concepts into plain english.  <em>#nofilter</em></h2>
  
  <p> <em><strong> Nothing is ever easy- </strong> </em> or so we think. </p>
  
  <p> 1 year of anguishing later, of whether to quit my stable job as a lawyer for a change, I found the courage to pivot into tech. </p>
  
  <p> The act of quitting was surprisingly easy, hand in your notice and <em>"le poof",</em> that's you. Early days so far, and I can truly say (for the first time in a long time) that I am loving it! </p>
  
  <p> I signed up to Dev Academy for three reasons: 
    <ol>
      <li> to pursue my love for learning;
      <li> to discover and open myself up to the realm of tech; and in doing so,</li>
      <li> improve my technical capability.</li>
      <br>
    </ol>
 With the added bonus of meeting some awesome people along the way 	＼(٥⁀▽⁀ )／.
     </p>

    <p> We had our first catch-up with our "home group". This was an interesting experience as we got to "meet" each other virtually over discord for the first time. Our first week was dedicated to setting our computers up to be able to use the tools required for the bootcamp. This in itself was an empowering experience! At first I was freaking out that I had missed something because of the numberous posts in the discord chat asking for help on topics I had no idea about. Fast forward to a week later, and it turns out those were windows specific issues- not mac. Thank goodness for using a mac at times like these (*￣▽￣)b. The relief and confidence it gave me when I had completed the set-up not only on time, but also early was a huge confidence boost. Next week we are starting to get into the nitty-gritty creation of the front-end of a web page using HTML, CSS and a taste of Java script. I am looking forward to the challenge.</p>
