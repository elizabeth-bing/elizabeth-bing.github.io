   <h1>Problem solving</h1>
   <h2> <em>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you... </em> </h2>

   <p>
    <strong> 1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</strong>
   </p>

    <p>
    <strong>What was the problem?</strong> I could not figure out how to show the method example in the terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong> Reading the error message, googled and console logging. 
    I ran the code in my console to identify the error - it turned out to be a "NaN" (not a number).  To fix the code I needed 
    to define access to the array properly, instead of using a "for" loop I googled the answer which turned out to be using the " …" 
    before the array variable name to access it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <strong>How did you feel throughout the process? </strong> Like I was going off the beaten track. It wasn't a well worn path, but I still found the answer nonetheless. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>What did you learn? </strong>I learned how to go out and look for answers to my problems.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      <strong> 2. elegantly solved a problem:</strong>
     </p>
  
      <p>
      <strong>What was the problem?</strong> The method functions were not working when being called in the terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong> Trying something and re-reading the instructions. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <strong>How did you feel throughout the process? </strong> Confident that the answer was in there, it was just the format of the code and not the substance that was incorrect. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>What did you learn? </strong>Attention to detail. Look through the code, the colour coding of Vscode was of great assistance because it turned out by copying the same example, it lost the coding and identified the wrong words as pre-declared when the code wasn't in the first place. Easily fixed by changing the names to result in different properties.
      </p>
 

      <p><strong>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes: 1=not confident, 10 = confident </strong></p>
