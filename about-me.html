  <h2> <strong> ELIZABETH BING </strong> </h2>
  
  <p class="p">I am a 3-year lawyer pivoting into IT. My goal is to work on emerging technologies while being
surrounded by talented, experienced professionals who I can learn the ins and outs of tech from. </p>

  <p class="p"> What excites me about technology? I am fascinated by how much our world revolves around data- no longer is “money king”; data is the new currency of today, and, with it, bringing many challenges. </p>

  <p class="p"> I love to tackle problems and sink my teeth into a project. Having dabbled in technology, one of my
favourite personal projects to date is the digitisation of internal processes. By creating bots and
automating part of my job, I optimised compliance administration resulting in efficiency gains and
improved consistency. I found myself enjoying the tech-side of my job more than the
actual lawyering, so much so, that I am now undertaking a full-stack bootcamp with Dev Academy. </p>

  <p class="p"> <strong> Let's build something together!</strong> </p>
