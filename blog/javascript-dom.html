   <p><strong> What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></p>
   <p> <em><strong> "The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” - Salovey and Mayer 1990 </strong> </em> </p>
      
   <p> <strong> How is it different to IQ? </strong></p>

     </ul>
